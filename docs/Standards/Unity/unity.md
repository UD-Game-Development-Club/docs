# The Basics

In the GDC, we have created our own [project template](https://github.com/UD-Game-Development-Club/unity-template) for `Unity 6000.0.23f1`. This will cover most of the basics as far as LFS configuration and basic scaffolding. We are currently looking into enabling [Unity Smart Merge](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SmartMerge.html) in the future, which should help with merge conflicts.
