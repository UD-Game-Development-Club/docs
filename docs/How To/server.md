## Dependencies

Please install the following:

- [wiregaurd](https://www.wireguard.com/)

You will also need a command line version of git. This comes by default on many linux/unix systems, but if youre on windows I reccomend installing [git bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (or using git through the CLI, assuming it's in your PATH).

!!! warning
    Please note, GitHub desktop (and likely other git clients) will not work for this configuration, due to some TLS issues.

## Wiregaurd setup

Please reach out to an officer for a wiregaurd config file. Once obtained, you will be able to add a tunnel through the wiregaurd GUI.

After adding the wiregaurd tunnel, you can click on the tunnel and "activate" or "deactivate" it.
