Date of Amendments: `N/A`

## Article I: Preamble

### Section 1. Name

The name of this organization established by this constitution shall be The University of Dayton Game Development Club (UD GDC)

### Section 2. Mission

We want to foster and grow an intersectional community of artists, developers, and musicians from the University of Dayton student body who collaborate on fun and engaging game development projects, to build connections and experience.

We envision this organization meeting weekly, where we will share and discuss personal projects and current industry events, as well as engage with invited speakers in person or remotely. In addition, we will participate intermittently in events such as Hackathons and Game Jams as a group. Depending on funding, we would like to travel to industry events such as conferences or in person Game Jams.

Goals for Spring 2025: We would like to build out our underclassman body, as well as establish internal documentation to consolidate our knowledge for future years. In addition, we would like to secure permanent university hosted infrastructure, where we can work on projects without bandwidth or storage limits traditionally imposed by platforms like GitHub and GitLab.
